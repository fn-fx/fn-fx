# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
A CLA is a document that specifies how a project is allowed to use your contribution.  We want a CLA that is simple and as clear as possible so that it doesn't impede contributions to the fn-fx project.

When you make a contribution to this project, you agree:

1. Your contribution is your original work (you own the copyright) or you otherwise have the right to submit the work.
2. You grant the project a nonexclusive, irrevocable license to use your submitted contribution in any way.
3. You are capable of granting these rights for the contribution.

By submitting a contribution to the fn-fx project you agree to the above statements.

# Contributing Issues

## Prerequisites

* [ ] Have you [searched for duplicates](https://github.com/pmonks/fn-fx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=)?  A simple search for exception error messages or a summary of the unexpected behaviour should suffice.
* [ ] Are you running the latest version?
* [ ] Are you sure this is a bug or missing capability?

## Raising an Issue
* Create your issue [here](https://github.com/pmonks/fn-fx/issues/new).
* The project provides a couple of issue templates  - please pick the most appropriate for your issue type.
* Please use [Markdown formatting](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) liberally to assist in readability.
  * [Code fences](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) for exception stack traces and log entries, to pick one example, massively improve issue readability.

# Contributing Pull Requests (Code & Docs)
To make review of PRs easier, please:

 * Please make sure your PRs will merge cleanly - PRs that don't are unlikely to be accepted.
 * For code contributions, follow the existing code layout.
 * For documentation contributions, follow the general structure, language, and tone of the existing docs.
 * Keep PRs small and cohesive - if you have multiple contributions, please submit them as independent PRs.
 * Reference issue #s if your PR has anything to do with an issue (even if it doesn't address it).
 * Minimise non-functional changes (e.g. whitespace shenanigans).
 * Ensure all new files include a header comment block containing the Eclipse Public License v1.0 and your copyright information.
 * If your PR adds dependencies, please call attention to that in the description of the PR.

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
